          <p class="intro">
            I Know you wonder what or who is N Cubed. Well, these are the initials of my 3 babies, my loves,
            my world, my everything in one.These three ninja's have brought so much joy in my life that when 
            i just think of them i find myself smilling and once in a while shed a tear of joy.

            Well, the work of raising them comes with its own challenges and there are days i feel like running 
            away for sure.All in all, sometimes when i need <strong><em>a miracle</em></strong> i look into <strong><em>my babies eyes</em></strong>
            and realize i have already created one.

      <div class="left">
        <p2>Our big man bazu.He is the first fruit of my womb. He was such a calm baby and is still is up to date. He is 8 years old
            and a serious gammer. When He is not glued to His video games, He is out riding His bicycle or being 
            cheeky with His sister. 

            He is my little helper when i get overwhelmed with His brother and you cannot miss to see the unconditonal 
            love He has for his siblings.

        <h2>NATANIELA</h2>
  
        <div class="right">
          <p2>She is our diva, the second fruit of my womb. She is too smart and witty for a 4 year old, the one who refused to learn
              swahili and instead chose the path of british english. Did i mention you will struggle to here her words?! yes
              you will, the accent is so heavy you would think She lives in the UK.

              She is curious in nature and many are the times She caused disaters in the house during Her exploration.
              A sassy one and loves to look pretty, so make up, beautiful dresses and adorable head gears are close
              to her heart.

          <p2>Our chubby cheeks. He is the third fruit of my womb. My last born...yes!! the last one. He joined
              us 8 months ago and it has never been a dull moment with Him being around. He is feisty and strong, a go getter
              who is relentless in fighting for what He wants.

              Our smilling and laughing machine. The one whose nickname is not coined from His actual Name...a
              story for another day..His siblings want to hoover around Him always, an indication of His gentle and 
              caring nature
