            I Know you wonder what or who is N Cubed. Well, these are the initials of my 3 babies, my loves,
            my world, my everything in one.These three ninja's have brought so much joy in my life that when 
            i just think of them i find myself smilling and once in a while shed a tear of joy.

            Well, the work of raising them comes with its own challenges and there are days i feel like running 
            away for sure.All in all, sometimes when i need <strong><em>a miracle</em></strong> i look into <strong><em>my babies eyes</em></strong>
            and realize i have already created one.

        <p2>He is the first fruit of my womb. He was such a calm baby and is still is up to date. He is 8 years old
            and a serious gammer. When He is not glued to His video games, He is out riding His bicycle or being 
            cheeky with His sister. 

            He is my little helper when i get overwhelmed with His brother and you cannot miss to see the unconditonal 
            love He has for his siblings.
